However, they require sufficient local computing resources, can involve complex setup and maintenance, have limited scalability compared to cloud solutions, and pose security risks if not properly managed. They are best suited for organizations that prioritize data privacy, cost efficiency, and customization, especially where internet access is limited or unavailable, provided they have the necessary infrastructure and security in place."
